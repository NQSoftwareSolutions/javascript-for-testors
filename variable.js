// Variables are simple containers which can be assigned any value of one type
// JS is dynamically typed language so we can assign multiple type opf values to one variable
// Variable at a one time , it has only one type of value
let i = 6 // good practice
var j = 10 // old practice should be avoided

console.log("Variable i is " + i)
console.log("Variable j is " + j)
